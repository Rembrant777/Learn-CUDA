# `cudnnActivationDescriptor`

This enumerated type is deprecated and is currently only used by deprecated APIs.
Consider using replacements for the deprecated APIs that use this enumerated type. 

It is a pointer to an opaque structure holding the description of an activation operation.
`cudnnCreateActivationDescriptor()` is used to create one instance, and `cudnnSetActivationDescriptor()` must be used to initialize this instance.
