# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
## ANN's  Terminologies 

## Preception
A neural network's basic operation is to perform dot operation between the input data and parameters which is called perception. 
In deep learning, the neural network connects multiple perceptions in a layered manner. 
And we call these feed-forward nerual networks. 

The perception's basic operation is to create a dot product with the input dat and appropriate weights. 
Then, it performs a non-linear operation with an activation function such as a sigmoid or rectifier linear unit(ReLU). 

A vector will be fed to the nerual network as input and multiplies it with weight parameters between each node in the layers.
