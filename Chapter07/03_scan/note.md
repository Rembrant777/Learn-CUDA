# An Introduction of Prefix Sum Scan 

## Introduction 
Prefix Sum Scan is a kind of parallel algoritm that designed to calculate each elements in the array's prefix-sum. 
Suppose there is an array A, its prefix-sum array is called B.
Each element in `B[i]` represents the accumulation of elements' in the range of`A[0] + ... + A[i]`

```latex
The prefix sum for an array \( A \) is given by:

\[ B[i] = \sum_{j=0}^{i} A[j] \]
```
